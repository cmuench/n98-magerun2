Warden comes with out-of-the-box support for n98-magerun2. You can use it in your Warden environment without any additional setup.

Example:

```bash
warden shell -c "n98-magerun <action>"
```

The alias `mr` is also available in the Warden shell, so you can use it like this:

```bash
warden shell -c "mr <action>"
```
