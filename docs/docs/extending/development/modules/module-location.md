## Where can modules be placed?

There are currently three possible base folders where you can place your modules.

* `/usr/local/share/n98-magerun2/modules`
* `~/.n98-magerun2/modules`
* `MAGENTO_ROOT/lib/n98-magerun2/modules`
* `%windir%\n98-magerun2\modules` (only Microsoft Windows)
* `%userprofile%\n98-magerun2\modules` (only Microsoft Windows)

These folders do not always exist and may need to be created. It is also wise to update `n98-magerun2.phar self-update` before adding modules.
